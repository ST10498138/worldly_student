        <h1>About Our Story</h1>

        <p><strong>Created in 2019</strong>, Worldly Student was born out of a simple but powerful idea: 
        to make the journey of international students less overwhelming. 
        What started as a few personal notes and shared tips quickly grew into a vision of creating a supportive guide 
        for all students abroad.</p>

        <p>Worldly Student was inspired by the personal experience of its founder. 
        As a student, she found herself in an English-speaking country where the initial adjustment was particularly challenging. 
        The lack of practical knowledge about the university system, local customs, and available resources led to several rookie mistakes.</p>

        <p>Looking back, she realized that a simple and accessible guide could have helped her avoid many obstacles. 
        This inspired her to create a platform to support international students in similar situations.</p>

        <p>In its early days, the project was nothing more than late-night ideas scribbled in notebooks and conversations 
        with fellow students. But with every challenge faced and every lesson learned, the vision became clearer: 
        <em>a platform where no student would feel lost or alone.</em></p>

        <p>Today, Worldly Student continues to grow as a global space where students find advice, encouragement, and community — 
        turning what can be a lonely experience into one full of connection and opportunity.</p>
