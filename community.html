                <p>The university path is often presented as a quest for knowledge, but for thousands of students, it's also a real obstacle course of financial and logistical hurdles.
                    The goal is no longer just to earn a degree but to **manage the inflation** of everyday expenses.
                    his reality directly impacts the quality of the student experience.
                </p>
                <p>However, their fight for peace is complicated by the emergence of titans, gigantic creatures threatening humanity.</p>
                <p>At the same time, strange phenomena are occurring, including the appearance of the Ajin, immortal beings hunted for their abilities. Kei, a teenager who became an Ajin after an accident, must navigate fear and hatred of humans while seeking to understand his newfound powers.</p>
                <p>Facing formidable opponents and traitors within their own group, they will discover that friendship, sacrifice, and courage are the true keys to overcoming challenges. Together, they will learn to harness their powers, confront their fears, and unravel the mysteries that could change the course of their destiny.</p>
